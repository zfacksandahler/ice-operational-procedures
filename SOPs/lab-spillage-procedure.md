# Standard Operating Procedure: Small-Scale Mercury Spillage in a Laboratory Setting

**SOP ID:** ICE-LAB-007  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Effective Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Review Cycle:** Annual  

## 1. Purpose
To establish a safe, effective, and repeatable procedure for the clean-up of small-scale mercury spills (≤10 mL) within a laboratory environment, minimizing exposure risk and environmental release.

## 2. Scope
This SOP applies to all ICE technicians and authorized laboratory personnel responding to a mercury spill of ≤10 mL on non‑porous surfaces (e.g., epoxy resin floors, stainless‑steel benches, chemical‑resistant countertops).

## 3. Responsibilities
- **Incident Commander:** Assesses the spill, determines the appropriate response level, and oversees the entire operation.
- **Decontamination Technician:** Executes the clean‑up using the prescribed equipment and methods.
- **Safety Officer:** Monitors airborne mercury levels, ensures personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance, and verifies that the area is safe for re‑entry.

## 4. Required Equipment
- Mercury‑specific spill kit (ICE P/N: MSK‑100)
- Personal protective equipment (PPE):
  - Nitrile gloves (double‑gloving recommended)
  - Tyvek® coverall with hood
  - Safety goggles or full‑face shield
  - Chemical‑resistant boots
- Portable HEPA‑vacuum with mercury‑specific filter (ICE P/N: HVP‑200)
- Mercury‑absorbent powder (Hg‑Absorb Plus)
- Plastic dustpan and scraper
- Sealed, leak‑proof hazardous‑waste containers (labelled “Mercury Waste”)
- Decontamination solution (10% sodium thiosulfate)
- pH paper (range 6–8)
- Flashlight for visual inspection of mercury beads

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1 Initial Assessment
1. **Secure the area:** Restrict access to the spill zone. Post warning signs.
2. **Don appropriate PPE** before approaching the spill.
3. **Estimate spill volume** and note any broken glass or sharp objects.
4. **Check ventilation:** Ensure local exhaust ventilation (e.g., fume‑hood sash) is operating.

### 5.2 Containment
1. Surround the spill with mercury‑absorbent powder to prevent further spread.
2. Gently push visible mercury beads toward the center using a plastic scraper.

### 5.3 Clean‑up
1. Apply a generous layer of mercury‑absorbent powder over the entire spill area.
2. Allow the powder to react for 15 minutes (or as per manufacturer’s instructions).
3. Using a plastic dustpan, collect the solidified material and place it into a designated hazardous‑waste container.
4. For residual fine particles, use the HEPA‑vacuum with the mercury‑specific filter, moving the nozzle slowly over the surface.
5. Repeat the powder application and vacuuming until no visible mercury remains.

### 5.4 Decontamination
1. Wipe the affected surface with a cloth soaked in 10% sodium thiosulfate solution.
2. Rinse the area with clean water and dry with disposable towels.
3. Verify the surface pH is neutral (6–8).

### 5.5 Final Inspection
1. Use a flashlight held at a low angle to inspect for any remaining mercury beads.
2. Monitor airborne mercury levels with a calibrated mercury‑vapor analyzer. The area must read ≤0.025 mg/m³ before re‑entry is permitted.

### 5.6 Waste Disposal
1. Seal all used absorbents, PPE, and cleaning materials in leak‑proof containers.
2. Label containers with “Mercury Waste,” date, and technician’s initials.
3. Store waste in the designated hazardous‑waste storage area until collected by ICE’s certified waste‑disposal partner.

## 6. Documentation
- Complete the **Mercury Spill Incident Report** (ICE Form‑12).
- Record the spill volume, location, personnel involved, and any deviations from this SOP.
- File the report in the ICE incident‑management system.
